# TransLex

An single page application for translating words or sentences between multiple languages. The aim of the project is to showcase the HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and various other tools for creating dynamic
interactive frontend applications.

Throughout this project I will try make use of Jquery for easier manipulation of the DOM and faster production of my application. Where I can I will try to also use plain old javascript if Jquery isnt needed!

## UX

An application created for mainly English people who would like to translate any word or sentence to a different language, this application gives the user the capability to translate English to a wide variety of languages.

The application is a SPA (single page application) scaled for devices for ease of access. 




Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

Particles JS used to create a modern background effect to interest the user, the background is interactive and live. Along with that, there is also interactive buttons dotted around the page
for interactiveity with the user. I wanted to create a minimal effect but informative aswell.

Overlay Nav was an alertnative to getting lots of infomation on the page whilst keeping the translator looking minimal.

### Existing Features

Yandex API used for Users to be able to input text into the form to translate a word or sentence into different languages.

Custom JS used to create abit of interactiveity on the page for UX.

#### Features to implement

Update app to have capability to translate any language to any language. (Not just english to XXXX)
Implement more UI/UX. Types.JS, Animate.CSS, Wow.JS - USing external sources/libaries to speed up development and not reinvent the wheel.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Particles JS] (https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

Site is going to be deployed to GitHub Pages via npm init and the package.json file including the github pages script to the dist folder.
Deployed version is using minified CSS.
